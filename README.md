WebServices.Java
=====================

This is a rudimentary integration with hard-coded soap-envelope strings it is intended as a jumpstart not as a full integration example.

The repository has been validated with Eclipse Standard/SDK Luna Release 4.4.0

This repository includes:

* MercuryWebServiceJavaSDK -- a Java library that will make the necessary calls to Mercury's webservices.
* MercuryWebServiceJavaIntegrationExample -- a sample integration utilizing the above library

##Step 1: Create the Soap Envelope

In this example the transaction string is hard coded, you can find it at the top of MercuryWSExample.java.  There is a credit example and a prepaid example.  This value is then passed to the MercuryWebServicejavaSDK where it is formatted into a valid Soap Envelope using the buildSOAPRequest method.

##Step 2: Create a connection to webservices

```
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)mWebServiceURL.openConnection();

conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setDoInput(true);
conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
conn.setReadTimeout(mTimeout);
conn.setConnectTimeout(mTimeout);
conn.setUseCaches(false);
conn.setDefaultUseCaches(false);
conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "text/xml; charset=utf-8");
conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", String.valueOf(soap.length()));
conn.setRequestProperty("SOAPAction", "\"" + mXMLNamespace + "/" + mWebMethodName + "\"");
conn.setRequestProperty("Connection", "Close");
```


##Step 3: Send Request

```
OutputStreamWriter wr = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
wr.write(soap);
wr.flush();
wr.close();
```

##Step 4: Get Response

```
rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
String responseBuffer = "";
while ((responseBuffer = rd.readLine()) != null)
  responseData += responseBuffer;
```
